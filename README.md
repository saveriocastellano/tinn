# TINN - 
TINN stands for TINN-Is-Not-NodeJS. 

TINN is a Javascript application toolkit based on the D8 Javascript shell from google-v8. TINN modifies D8 through a patch
file in order to add to it the capability of dynamically loading external C++ modules. 

Similarly to native modules in NodeJS, external modules are native shared libraries that provide additional functionalities that are exported to the Javascript context. 

Application based on TINN are entirely written in Javascript and run through the (modified) D8 shell. 
Support for threads is available through the 'Worker' Javascript class implemented in D8.
